** Value of cards **

The value of cards two through ten is their pip value (2 through 10).
Face cards (Jack, Queen, and King) are all worth ten.
Aces can be worth one or eleven. -> If sum of cards (hand's value) is greater than 21, Ace has value 1

** Win **

In my country, this is the method to win.
If you have 5 cards and sum of cards (hand's value) is less than or equal to 21
-> "Five cards"

1 Ace and 1 ten-value card or 2 Aces
-> "Blackjack"

With 21 points (normal)

- Player has value that is less than or equal to 21
    * Value (dealer) is less than or equal to 21
	+ Player > Dealer -> Player wins
	+ Dealer > Player -> Dealer wins
	+ Player = Dealer -> Draw ("Push" - No one wins)
    * Value (dealer) is greater than 21 -> Player wins

- Player has value that is greater than 21
    * Value (dealer) is less than or equal to 21 -> Dealer wins
    * Value (dealer) is greater than 21 -> Draw ("Push" - No one wins)

If player or dealer has value (hand's value) that is greater than 28, he lose ("Lost all" -> I don't know how to call in English)
-> This player or dealer must pay all players's bet to them
(In case player pay to dealer, value of dealer is player bet because dealer doesn't bet)

* Prioritize to win:
"Five cards" > "Blackjack" > Normal

** Start **

Player bets with 5 values and 1 choice 'all-in'
Each player has 2 cards and the first card open

** Player's turn (hand) **

Player decisions:
  Hit
  Stand
  Double
  Give up (Surrender)
  Insurance

- Hit: Take another card from the dealer.
- Stand: Take no more cards.
- Double: Take another card from the dealer and increse bet (100% player's bet)
- Give up (Surrender): Doesn't play and must split the bet (player lost 1/2 coins)
- Insurance: Player can bet 1/2 value of coins but the first card of dealer must be Ace

Once all the players have completed their hands, it is the dealer's turn.

** Dealer **

Dealer must open his cards.
If it's "blackjack", player had "Insurance", he get their bet in this case.
Dealer draws or opens player's cards
