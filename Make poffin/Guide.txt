** Instruction **

In the link, there are script and graphics.
Graphics: Put the both in 'Graphics\Pictures'
Script: Put these script above 'Main'

After that, play 'new game' for using this.

- Make poffin -
Call:
FeaturesPoffin.play # -> for playing

* Before you play, you can set rule for this. (These rules need to call above "FeaturesPoffin.play")
Call:
setRulesPoffin("notSame") # -> Player cant use the same berry. If it's same, you must get Foul poffin -> +2 random 3 condition
setRulesPoffin("quantity",number) # -> Change number into 0, 1, 2, 3 -> If you set the different number, you will get error. The quantity of players is 1, 2, 3, 4. If you dont call it, you will play alone

* Next, you can set the skill of player, call:
setRulesPoffin("newbie") # -> newbie
setRulesPoffin("oldbie") # -> oldbie, players played it many times
setRulesPoffin("expert") # -> expert, you knew it

* If you play in multiple mode, one of 3 lines above, it will set 100% playes who is 'quality' like in ( ).
But, if you want in your game, there are newbie, oldbie and expert.
You need to set number after that, it is percentage of player.
If you set wrong, you will get error.

* The distance in mode 3 players between 1 and 2 playes is 30 -> <=30: 1 player; >30 (->) <=60: 2 players; >60 (->) 100: 3 players
Example like I said above:
setRulesPoffin("newbie",30)
setRulesPoffin("oldbie",30)
setRulesPoffin("expert",30)

* The other example: 2 expert, 1 newbie
setRulesPoffin("newbie",20)
setRulesPoffin("expert",55)

* The other example: in mode 3 players, 1 newbie, 1 oldbie (The distance is 50 for 1 player)
setRulesPoffin("newbie",25)
setRulesPoffin("oldbie",35)

*** If you dont set rule skill for player, it will be newbie. ***

- Set berry
You can set berry for expert who use it in 'module BerryPoffin' -> 'BerryExpert'. Add like the example, you can change it.
You can change the number each flavor in 'module FlavorPoffin'.
In this module, you can see 'Flavor_Multiple_Mode' -> Use when you play multiple mode and 'Flavor_Alone_Mode' -> Use when you play alone.
Moreover, you must to add the name the berry or change the 'sheen' number condition in 'Smoothness' (in 'module FlavorPoffin', of course).

- Modify graphics -
In file '2 - Init' of folder '2 - Play poffin', you can find some numbers: RadiusCore, LimitScale -> You need to change if you change the size of bottle.
The lines below "LimitScale" is the time when you finish. (Attention, if you want to change it, you need to change the AI too. Maybe, I set AI not good but you need to read the script and rewrite it if you want to change)

And, the value "MaxPoffin = [true,999]" -> It will set the limit, read the comments.

- Poffin case -
In '1 - Set variable - position' of '3 - Poffin case', it's the position when you click it. If you rewrite, you need to change it too.
You can call in event like: 'FeaturesPoffin.eat'
If you want to use it like item, read in file '1 - Set variable - position' of folder '3 - Poffin case'
