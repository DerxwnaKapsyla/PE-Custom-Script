* Graphics:
	Puts it in Graphics\Pictures (both of folder)

* Script:
	Puts it above Main. 
	Just choose one ( All (many scripts) or One for all (only one) ).
	If you use All (many scripts), puts the scripts is in order.
	It's same but with One for all (only one), modifying is hard.

* Note:

There are many files (.txt) for copy and paste. So, you need to look at the number, it's the order when you paste in your project.
There are many lines if you want to modify something. Just read carefully.
I hope you guys reads carefully instruction.
Poffin case is the script not support keyboard. You need to add if you want to use.
