You need a item which calls "Silph Scope". 

You need a add the line in items.txt like this

634,SILPHSCOPE,Silph Scope,Silph Scope,8,0,"A scope that makes unseeable POKÃ©MON visible. It is made by Silph Co.",0,0,6,

You can change the first number and the name but if you change the name, you need to change the name in the script too.



Put item in icon folder and image of the ghost in battlers folder.

Put the script above the Main.



Change or add new map id in GHOSTMAPS.



Example: 

Here, GHOSTMAPS=[50,51,52,53,54,66].

It means in map id (50,51,52,53,54,66), if you fight pokemon and you don't have item "Silph Scope", you will fight with Ghost.
