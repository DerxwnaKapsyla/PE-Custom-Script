# How to use
### Read to learn how to add event
You need to read guide in file `0 - 2 - Guide`

Example `Cutscene: Ho-oh`, I put it in folder `0 - 3 - Set value`, read to set event.
> File `1 - Hooh.rb`

If you want to create new event, you can set it in same file `1 - Hooh.rb` or create new file in folder `0 - 3 - Set value`.

### Call event
Call: CustomScene.show(name, frames)
##### name
> This is `name` that you set in file `1 - Hooh.rb` or new file you created
##### frames
> After `frames` frames, event will finish.
