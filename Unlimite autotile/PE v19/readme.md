Puts 'Script.rar' in '\Plugins\Unlimite autotile'



Read first lines in '1-1 - Set value.rb' to change tile into autotile



If you use 'Soot grass' script or 'Hide trainer' script, don't set autotile in the maps that use these scripts.



Use tool 'Draw bitmap' in my Github to define numbers in tileset.
