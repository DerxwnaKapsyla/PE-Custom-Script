You have 2 methods for delete the photos:

Moreover, you can delete the photos anything you like, this script will rename for you.
(Remember: don't rename if you don't know how this script works).
+ In game, you can delete only one photo if you want to. Of course, this script will rename these files for you.

About folder "Album", you don't need to create this folder, this script will helps you do this.

You can move Right, Left, Up, Down the photo and zoom in and zoom out the photos (x1.1,x1.2,x1.3,etc,x2.0)

-Of course, you can change color of the sky, too.
-You can change the scene, it depends on seasons ( each month, you have each season. Example: Jan: Spring; Feb: Summer; Mar: Autumn; Apr: Winter; May: Spring; etc).
