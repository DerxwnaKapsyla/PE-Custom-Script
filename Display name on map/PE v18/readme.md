#** How to use **
Read the lines in SetNameForDisplay and the first lines.
DisplayNameVariable is number of game switch. Example: DisplayNameVariable = 100 # It means you use slot 100
And you need to set it on after set the name of player, the best choice is before transfer player.
If you use shadow of Marin and following pokemon, you should put it above this script (script of Marin). If not, put this script above Main.

#** Note **
If you put a lot of names, the game will be laggy.
